For the Pittsburgh workshop on Technology for Language Documentation and Revitalization
(August 12-16, 2019)

Scenario: Teacher identifies a pattern of pedagogical interest, such as a word or a phrase.
This program should find uses of that pattern in a given corpus.

I will start this program as a straightforward pattern-matching function but it can later
evolve into something more complex (e.g.: allomorphy, complex syntactic phenomena which manifest themselves
in a variety of ways, etc.)
